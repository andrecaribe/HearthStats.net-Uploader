HearthStats.net Uploader
========================

This is a Java based utility designed to run in the background and automatically
upload your win ratios and other statistics to [HearthStats.net](http://HearthStats.net)
while you play Hearthstone. This program uses screen grab analysis of your Hearthstone window
and does not do any packet sniffing, monitoring, or network modification of any kind.

This project is and always will be open source so that you can do your own builds 
and see exactly what's happening within the program. 

Features
--------------------

* Support for both Windows and OSx
* Automatically tracks constructed and arena matches
* Tracks your class and your opponent's class
* Tracks your rank level for ranked matches
* Tracks your opponent's name
* Tracks number of rounds played and match duration
* Add notes to your matches directly from the uploader
